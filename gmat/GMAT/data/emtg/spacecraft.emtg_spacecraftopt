#note to Steve and Don - in EMTG a spacecraft is composed of stages. You only have one stage in this mission.
#I turned off the propellant tank constraints here.
#I also turned off everything related to dry mass computation, because you don't need that for this project.

#note to Steve and Don - since you are at 1 AU the power system model doesn't matter, but just in case I gave you the ARRM power system.
#I did not model the bus power because at 1 AU you can just subtract it off the max array capacity. So your arrays are actually bigger than the 40 kW shown here
