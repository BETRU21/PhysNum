    directory. You should have the filter files we saw previously, and two new
    files there &ndash; smoother.txt and smoother.mat. Let&rsquo;s start with
    smoother.txt.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Open smoother.txt for reading in a text editor.</p></li></ol></div><p>The smoother.txt file is identical in format to the filter output
    file. At the top, we see the smoother initial conditions. Notice now that
    the starting state for the backward filter is the ending state for the
    filter forward run. The force modeling, spacecraft hardware, measurement
    modeling are the same as those used in the forward filter.</p><p>The SMOOTHER MEASUREMENT RESIDUALS is also identical in format to
    the FILTER MEASUREMENT RESIDUALS report. The smoother residuals report
    shows the measurement residuals versus states computed from the smoother.
    For this reason they are reported in forward time order. The smoother
    operates in forward time order when fusing the forward and backward filter
    runs. Residuals from the backward filter run are not included by default
    in the smoother output report, but are included in the smoother MATLAB
    file.</p><p>Next in the smoother output report are the smoother measurement
    summary statistics. Again, the report format is identical to that found in
    the filter. As in the filter, we should expect to see most of the
    measurements accepted. Under certain circumstances, the backward filter
    can diverge and edit out large amounts of measurement data, so the analyst
    should carefully review the smoother output to be certain this did not
    occur.</p><p>Next comes the smoother state information. This is the smoother
    state at the end time of the measurement data, and it therefore matches
    the filter end state exactly. Remember that the backward filter starts at
    the end time of the forward filter, so the backward filter, the forward
    filter, and consequently the smoother, all match at the last
    measurement.</p><p>Lastly comes the SMOOTHER COVARIANCE REPORT. This is again identical
    in format to the filter covariance report, but instead reporting the
    smoother covariance. The function of the smoother is to improve the
    accuracy of the estimated states and due to the mathematics of the
    smoother, the smoother covariance is always smaller than the covariance of
    the forward filter. This may be difficult to see in the smoother output
    report, but it will be clearer when we examine plots of results from the
    smoother MATLAB file. Let&rsquo;s do that now.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" start="2" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>If you are not there already, open a DOS prompt and navigate to
        the directory containing the sample Python analysis scripts.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In that directory, type the following:</p></li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting">python plot_covariance.py <span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;full path to smoother.mat&gt;</em></span>
</pre><p>In a few seconds, you should see a plot similar to that below.
    Compare this to the plot we previously generated for the filter position
    covariance and note the differences. This plot does not exhibit the
    &ldquo;converging&rdquo; behavior in the previous forward filter plot, and all the
    components of uncertainty are at least a little smaller than those from
    the forward filter. This reflects the fact that each point in the smoother
    contains information obtained from measurements both in the past and in
    the future of that point. By contrast, each point in the forward filter
    run contains only information from the past of that point, since the
    forward filter only processes measurements forward in time. Having more
    information about the state at a particular point in time (in this case
    derived from both the past and future trajectory of that point) improves
    knowledge of the state and therefore reduces the uncertainty of the
    state.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="100%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="../files/images/Tut_FilterSmoother_GpsPosVec_Fig5.png" align="middle" height="479"></td></tr></table></div></div><p>We notice as well as considerable U-shape to the V-component of
    uncertainty. The other components also show signs of being noisier at the
    beginning and end of the span. This is again a consequence of how the
    smoother operates. States near the start of the span have a lot of
    information from the backward filter, but not much from the forward
    filter. Similarly, states near the end have a lot of information from the
    forward filter, but not much from the backward filter. States near the
    center of the run have the greatest amount of information from both the
    forward and backward filter and therefore have the smallest
    uncertainty.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" start="4" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>In the script directory, type the following:</p></li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting">python plot_solve_fors.py <span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;full path to smoother.mat&gt;</em></span>
</pre><p>After a few seconds, you should see a plot similar to the one below.
    This displays the smoother estimate of the coefficient of drag.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="100%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="../files/images/Tut_FilterSmoother_GpsPosVec_Fig6.png" align="middle" height="479"></td></tr></table></div></div><p>The envelope of uncertainty around the smoother Cd estimate shows
    behavior similar to that in the smoother plots for position and velocity.
    Near the start and end of the run, there is less information about the
    estimate, and therefore more uncertainty, than near the center.</p><p>The last step in QA of the filter and smoother run requires us to
    generate what are called &ldquo;filter-smoother consistency plots&rdquo;. We now have
    two complete forward estimated time histories of the spacecraft state &ndash;
    the state estimates we got from the forward filter, and the state
    estimates from the forward smoother (after backward filtering). These
    plots will allow us to see if the filter state estimate and uncertainty
    are &ldquo;consistent&rdquo; with the smoother state estimate and uncertainty. In
    other words, if the forward filter places the spacecraft at a certain
    location with a particular uncertainty, is the smoother state and its
    uncertainty reasonably within bounds of the filter state and
    uncertainty?</p><p>As an example, consider a case where the filter estimate places the
    spacecraft at point A with an uncertainty of 10 meters. Now let&rsquo;s say the
    smoother estimate at the same time places the spacecraft at point B with
    an uncertainty of 5 meters. If the distance between point A and B is 7
    meters, then we can say that the filter estimate is &ldquo;consistent&rdquo; with the
    smoother estimate. The distance between point A and point B is within the
    uncertainties of the locations of point A and point B.</p><p>On the other hand, let&rsquo;s consider the case where point A (with 10
    meters uncertainty) and point B (with 5 meters uncertainty), are found to
    be 100 meters apart. This error in estimated location between the filter
    (point A) and the smoother (point B) is much larger than should be
    expected based on the reported uncertainties of each estimate. In this
    case, we would say that the filter and smoother estimates are not
    consistent, and should begin to look for sources of modeling error in
    either the filter or smoother. The filter-smoother consistency plot will
    perform this comparison for us at every point over the entire span of the
    run and generate a plot showing a metric that represents the level of
    consistency between the filter and smoother runs.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" start="5" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>In the script directory, type the following:</p></li></ol></div><pre class="programlisting">python filter_smoother_consistency.py <span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;full path to filter.mat&gt; &lt;full path to smoother.mat&gt;</em></span>
</pre><p>After a few seconds, you should see a plot similar to the one below.
    This displays the filter-smoother position consistency.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="100%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="../files/images/Tut_FilterSmoother_GpsPosVec_Fig7.png" align="middle" height="479"></td></tr></table></div></div><p>This plot shows the filter-smoother consistency for the components
    of the spacecraft position vector in a VNB frame. The plot for velocity
    consistency is similar. You should also review the filter-smoother
    consistency of all other estimated parameters. The script should also have
    generated a consistency plot for the coefficient of drag. Since Cd is just
    a scalar value, the Cd consistency plot shows only one data series. The
    consistency metric measures the filter and smoother state differences
    against their uncertainties, so we expect, in a well-tuned filter, to see
    the majority of the metric in the &plusmn;3 range. If this is not the case, you
    should begin examining the filter configuration. Possible sources of poor
    filter-smoother consistency are things like poor force modeling, unknown
    or unmodeled forces like thrusting events, excessive data editing, and
    inappropriately tuned state noise or FOGM variables.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table summary="Navigation footer" width="100%"><tr><td align="left" width="40%"><a accesskey="p" href="ch15s05.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td align="center" width="20%"><a accesskey="u" href="FilterSmoother_GpsPosVec.html">Up</a></td><td align="right" width="40%">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch15s07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="40%">Modify the estimation script to use a smoother to improve the
