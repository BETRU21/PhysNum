</pre><p>The first line of the file is a comment line indicating that this
      is a file containing measurement data stored in GMAT&rsquo;s internal format.
      There are 4 lines of data representing range data at two successive
      times and Doppler data at two successive times. As we expected, we have
      no more than 4 total measurements. Refer to the <a class="xref" href="TrackingDataTypes.html" title="Tracking Data Types for Orbit Determination"><span class="refentrytitle">Tracking Data Types for Orbit Determination</span></a> Help for a description of the range and
      Doppler GMD file format.</p><p>We now analyze the first line of data which represents a DSN two
      way range measurement at the start of the simulation at '10 Jun 2010
      00:00:00.000 UTCG&rsquo; which corresponds to the output TAI modified Julian
      Day of 25357.5003935185185185185199... TAIMJD.</p><p>The second and third fields, DSN_SeqRange and 9003, are just
      internal GMAT codes indicating the use of DSN range (Trk 2-34 type 7)
      data.</p><p>The 4th field, MeasureSat, is the Downlink ID. This is the ID we
      gave the <span class="guilabel">Spacecraft</span>
      <span class="guilabel">SimMeasureSat</span> object. The 5th field, ObservedSat,
      is the spacecraft ID,which is the ID we gave the
      <span class="guilabel">SimSat</span> <span class="guilabel">Spacecraft</span> object that
      we created.</p><p>The 6th field, 3.3458274023216171e+06, is the actual DSN range
      observation value in RU.</p><p>The 7th field, 2, is an integer which represents the Uplink Band
      of the uplink <span class="guilabel">Spacecraft</span>,
      <span class="guilabel">SimMeasureSat</span>. The designation, 2, represents
      X-band. See the <span class="guilabel">RunSimulator</span> Help for a detailed
      discussion of how GMAT determines what value should be written here. As
      described in the Help, since we are not using a ramp table, GMAT
      determines the Uplink Band by looking at the transmit frequency of the
      <span class="guilabel">Transmitter</span> object attached to the
      <span class="guilabel">SimMeasureSat</span> spacecraft. GMAT knows that the 7200
      MHz value that we assigned to <span class="guilabel">SimMeasureSat&rsquo;s</span>
      <span class="guilabel">Transmitter</span> resource,
      <span class="guilabel">MeasurementTransmitter</span>, corresponds to an X-band
      frequency.</p><p>The 8th field, 7.2e+009, is the transmit frequency of
      <span class="guilabel">SimMeasureSat</span> at the time of the measurement. Since
      we are not using a ramp table, this value will be constant for all
      measurements and it is given by the value of the frequency of the
      <span class="guilabel">Transmitter</span> object,
      <span class="guilabel">MeasurementTransmitter</span>, that we attached to the
      <span class="guilabel">MeasureSat</span> spacecraft. Recall the following script
      segment, <code class="code">DSNTransmitter.Frequency = 7200; %MHz</code>, from the
      <a class="xref" href="Create_and_configure_the_spacecraft_spacecraft_hardware_and_related_parameters.html#Create_a_Receiver_object_and_attach_it_to_the_measurement_spacecraft" title="Create a Receiver object and attach it to the measurement spacecraft">Create
      a Receiver object and attach it to the measurement spacecraft</a> section.</p><p>The 9th field, 3.3554432e+07, represents the integer range modulo
      number that helps define the DSN range measurement. This is the value
      that we set when we created and configured the
      <span class="guilabel">TrackingFileSet</span> <span class="guilabel">DSNsimData</span>

      the ranging code in RU.</p><p>We now analyze the second line of data which represents a DSN two
      way Doppler measurement at the start of the simulation at '10 Jun 2010
      00:00:00.000 UTCG&rsquo; which corresponds to the output TAI modified Julian
      Day of 25357.5003935185185185185199... TAIMJD.</p><p>The second and third fields, Doppler and 9005, are just internal
      GMAT codes indicating the use of DSN Doppler (derived from two
      successive Trk 2-34 type 17 Total Count Phase measurements) data.</p><p>The 4th field, MeasureSat, is the Downlink ID. This is the ID we

      range measurement, the designation, 2, represents X-band.</p><p>The 7th field, 10, is the Doppler Count Interval (DCI) used to
