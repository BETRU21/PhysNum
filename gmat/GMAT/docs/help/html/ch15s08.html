    the filter performance, without really explaining where they came from.
    These are things like the magnitude of the process noise, the sigma and
    half-life for estimation of the coefficient of drag, and the initial orbit
    state uncertainty. In an exercise using simulated data, it is not hard to
    find values that work well, since we already know the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; that was
    employed in the simulation. When working with real mission data however,
    the situation is much different. You may have some initial guess of the
    coefficient of drag, but you might not know the error in your guess, or
    how much the coefficient of drag might vary due to possibly dynamic
    spacecraft area. Even deciding which parameters to estimate and which to
    apply can be a difficult question to answer. The process of finding
    appropriate values for all the parameters that affect filter performance
    is filter &ldquo;tuning&rdquo;. The goal of filter tuning is to achieve a filter that
    runs continuously (using warm starts) with minimal need for
    reinitialization, and that yields a covariance that hopefully
    realistically captures the true orbit uncertainty. The process of tuning a
    filter often requires analysis and experimentation with all the parameters
    just mentioned. It is furthermore a good idea to examine filter
    performance under a range of your spacecraft&rsquo;s environmental conditions.
    For example, a tuning for a low-Earth spacecraft that works well during
    solar minimum may be stressed or fail during solar maximum. We can offer a
    few tips to those new to the filter tuning game.</p><p>The Spacecraft initial OrbitErrorCovariance represents the
    uncertainty in the initial spacecraft state you are providing on the
    Spacecraft object. In general, an &ldquo;order of magnitude&rdquo; guess is sufficient
    for the initial covariance. The filter will soon &ldquo;forget&rdquo; this initial
    value anyway as it automatically adjusts the covariance in response to the
    measurements and process noise. While the OrbitErrorCovariance is a full
    6x6 matrix, common practice is to specify only the diagonal elements,
    representing the uncertainties in the initial position and velocity
    components. To ascertain whether your values are appropriate, examine the
    filter output at the start of the run. If your initial state is close in
    time to the first measurement and the filter diverges (begins
    sigma-editing most or all data) immediately, or very soon, after the first
    measurement, adjust the OrbitErrorCovariance. An OrbitErrorCovariance that
    is too small will result in immediate data editing (&ldquo;divergence&rdquo;) due to
    the scaled residual edit check failing to capture the measurements.
    However, an OrbitErrorCovariance that is too large can also cause
    divergence. If the initial uncertainty is too large, the filter will
    accept the first few measurements, but the covariance will collapse too
    rapidly around a still poorly-estimated state, which will likely lead
    rapidly to divergence. Use of measurement deweighting can help ameliorate
    this condition (see the <a class="xref" href="ExtendedKalmanFilter.html" title="ExtendedKalmanFilter"><span class="refentrytitle">ExtendedKalmanFilter</span></a>
    MeasDewighting parameters). If possible, it is best to work with an
    initial state that has an epoch close to the first measurements. If your
    initial state is not close to the first measurement, propagation of the
    initial state to the time of the first measurement introduces process
    noise, which means you will need to try to tune both the initial orbit
    uncertainty and state noise model at the same time.</p><p>Choosing appropriate values for stochastic models like a first-order
    Gauss-Markov drag model requires some experimentation. For the spacecraft
    coefficient of drag, you can begin from the basis that most coefficients
    of drag are between 2.0 and 2.5. A long half-life (one to ten days) is
    usually a good choice, especially if you don&rsquo;t know the actual value of
    drag very well. A short half-life will cause the drag estimate to rapidly
    decay back to the nominal (steady-state) value, which is not a good option
    if your chosen steady-state value is not close to the true value. A longer
    half-life allows the filter more time to sense and adjust to the true
    value.</p><p>Choosing appropriate process noise can be the most opaque and
    mysterious part of filter tuning. The units of acceleration noise sigma
    for GMAT&rsquo;s StateNoiseCompensation algorithm are km per second^(3/2), which
    does not lend itself easily to an intuitive interpretation. Reference 2
    recommends the following starting point for along-track process noise for
    near-circular orbits dominated by along-track error (as is the case for
    most spacecraft affect by drag):</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../files/images/Resource_ProcessNoiseModel_SNC_QTuning.png" align="middle" height="70"></div></div><p>Where <m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:db="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" display="inline">

    seconds (Reference 2, eq. 2.88). Note that the square root of
    <span class="emphasis"><em>q<sub>AT</sub></em></span> is specified when
    inputting the components of the AccelNoiseSigma on a process noise
    model.</p><p>Process noise drives the growth of position and velocity uncertainty
    in the absence of measurements. The effect of this is most easily seen by
    examining plots of position and velocity uncertainty and looking at how
    large they get while propagating the orbit between tracking passes. Try to
    make a judgement whether the growth is consistent with what the actual
    orbit uncertainty might be. For example, a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft
    receiving one or two 20-minute passes per orbit might be expected to
    experience less than 100 meters prediction error per orbit, if the orbit
    is well-estimated and drag conditions are not rapidly changing. If plots
    of position covariance show the uncertainty growing to a kilometer between
    passes, it is likely that the process noise is too large. It can be easy
    for a filter with too much process noise to look like it is performing
    well, because it will generally easily accept all of the incoming
    measurement data. However, the estimated state will not be as accurate as
    it could be and will likely predict poorly.</p><p>Examining the &ldquo;pre-update&rdquo; residual of the first measurement of each
    tracking pass is a useful exercise. The pre-update residual is the filter
    state measurement residual prior to incorporating (or rejecting) the
    measurement. This gives you an indication of how well the filter is
    predicting. Ideally these first-measurement pre-update residuals should
    not be biased (should not be predominantly positive or negative). Under
    most conditions, prediction error is larger than measurement noise, so the
    population of first measurement residuals should roughly reflect the state
    prediction accuracy. The Filter Measurement Residuals section of GMAT&rsquo;s
    filter output report shows pre-update residuals. Examining plots of
    pre-update residuals is usually more useful than scanning the report
    visually.</p><p>There are three essential tools for assessing filter performance &ndash;
    scaled residual plots, filter-smoother consistency checks, and ephemeris
    comparisons.</p><p>&ldquo;Scaled residuals&rdquo; or &ldquo;residual ratios&rdquo; are the filter raw
    measurement (pre-update) residual divided by (roughly) the sum of the
    state uncertainty and measurement noise. The scaled residual is the metric
    the filter uses when deciding to accept or reject a new measurement. If
    the scaled residual exceeds the filter ScaledResidualThreshold, the
    measurement is rejected by the sigma-edit criteria. Another very useful
    aspect of the scaled residual is that it is dimensionless, which means it
    gives you a way to examine the processing of all measurement types in a
    single plot, rather than looking at separate plots of Doppler, range, and
    angle residuals. You can see the residual ratios in the Filter Covariance
    Report section of the GMAT filter output report file, but viewing them in
    a graph (as we did previously in Section 3 above) is much more useful. A
    scaled residual plot can quickly show you in a glance how much of your
    data was accepted (below the scaled residual threshold) and how much is
    rejected. We expect a well-tuned filter to accept nearly all incoming
    measurements (except for those known to be erroneous, biased, or otherwise
    anomalous).</p><p>Scaled residual plots can also tell you other useful things about
    how the filter is performing. Take a look at the scaled residual plot
    shown below.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="100%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="../files/images/Tut_FilterSmoother_GpsPosVec_Fig9.png" align="middle" height="479"></td></tr></table></div></div><p>If we just looked quickly at our filter output report, we might be
    happy with this run, because 100% of the data was accepted. However, the
    scaled residual plot shows that all of the scaled residuals are squashed
    on a line close to zero. This tells us that the divisor in the scaled
    residual computation (the sum of the process noise and measurement noise)
    is much larger than the raw measurement residual. From this, we can
    conclude that either the process noise or assumed measurement noise is too
    large. (If you see a plot like this, it is most often the case that the
    measurement noise is too large. For reasonable values of process noise,
    the &ldquo;spread&rdquo; of scaled residuals is indicative of how large the modeled
    measurement noise is relative to the actual measurement noise.)
    Mathematically speaking, we are not extracting as much value from the
    residuals as we should be. A well-tuned filter should spread the scaled
    residuals more evenly through the full range of the scaled residual
    acceptance region. While strictly speaking it might be considered best to
    see the scaled residuals cover the entire scaled residual acceptance range
    (with maybe even a little spillover), in operational practice it usually
    good to leave a little overhead (perhaps 1-sigma) between the envelope of
    scaled residuals and the scaled residual threshold. This allows the filter
    to be more robust to small unpredictable variations that come from solar
    activity, mis-modeled media corrections, small measurement biases, and the
    like.</p><p>Secondly, when running both the filter and smoother, filter-smoother
    consistency checks are very useful for assessing your tuning. As was
    described in above, we should expect that the filter state and associated
    uncertainty are statistically &ldquo;consistent&rdquo; with the smoother state and its
    uncertainty. For low-Earth spacecraft especially, it is typical for the
    filter-smoother consistency metric to occasionally stray outside the ideal
    range, but excesses should not be extreme or of long duration. Poor
    filter-smoother consistency is a sign that the filter tuning is at least
    somewhat amiss. Poorly-modeled maneuvers can be one source of poor
    consistency. In this case, intervention is not typically warranted, as the
    consistency should return to normal in later post-maneuver runs. Short
    spans of data editing, sudden solar activity, or other temporary events
    affecting force modeling can also cause transient issues with
    filter-smoother consistency. Temporary excesses of the consistency metric
    are not usually a problem as long as they can be associated with some
    known or suspected phenomena. Consistently poor filter-smoother
    consistency should be addressed by reexamining filter tuning in the areas
    of propagation model fidelity, process noise, and estimated parameter
    modeling.</p><p>Lastly, ephemeris compares should always be performed, and most
    importantly, trends of predicted accuracy should be maintained and
    periodically compared against mission requirements and past results. Prior
    to launch, most missions perform detailed analysis to determine the proper
    tracking schedule and measurement types needed to meet mission orbit
    accuracy requirements. Routine navigation operations should assess orbit
    determination performance against these requirements. Both predicted and
    definitive ephemeris data should be generated each time the filter is run,
    and the accuracy of each new prediction should be later assessed against a
    definitive ephemeris to measure the prediction error. Keep a record of
    prediction error over consistent spans that are relevant to mission
    requirements. For example, if your mission has a requirement of a 48-hour
    prediction accuracy of better than 2 kilometers, make sure that every
    filter (or smoother) run generates at least 48 hours of predicted
    ephemeris data. Compare this prediction later to a new definitive filter
    ephemeris to determine the accuracy of the prediction. Besides ensuring
    that you are meeting mission requirements, comparison of actual prediction
    accuracy to predicted orbit uncertainty covariance is a useful way of
    assessing the realism of the filter predicted orbit covariance.</p><p>Here are some additional tips to help develop your &ldquo;filter
    intuition&rdquo;.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>If the state estimation error is very small or the measurement
        is very noisy, the state change when incorporating a measurement is
        small and the filter &ldquo;trusts&rdquo; the current orbit estimate more than the
        new measurement. This is the situation if the state is &ldquo;well-known&rdquo; or
        the observation is low-quality.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the state is poorly known or the measurement is very good
        (low noise), the state is strongly corrected by the new measurement.
        In this case, the filter is &ldquo;following the data&rdquo; more than trusting
        the state estimate.</p></li></ul></div><p>The estimation error covariance after the measurement update is
    always less than the estimation error covariance before the measurement
    update. Using an observation always reduces the orbit error covariance, no
    matter how bad the observation is. Addition of process noise always
    increases the state uncertainty. So there is a balance here &ndash;
    incorporating a measurement always decreases the state uncertainty and
    process noise always increases the state uncertainty. Filter convergence
    and long-term performance depends on this balance. If measurement or
    process noise are too small, the orbit error covariance may become too
    small and the filter may begin to reject good measurements. The filter
    will eventually diverge &ndash; this is called &ldquo;smugness&rdquo;. If process noise is
    too large, the filter will predict poorly and have little &ldquo;memory&rdquo; of
    state information. The filter state will depend mostly on only the latest
    measurements and will act like a short-arc batch least-squares estimator.
    It is helpful for a filter to have a &ldquo;memory&rdquo; of prior measurements, since
    this allows the filter more accurately estimate sometimes hard-to-observe
    parameters like drag or orbital plane.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table summary="Navigation footer" width="100%"><tr><td align="left" width="40%"><a accesskey="p" href="ch15s07.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td align="center" width="20%"><a accesskey="u" href="FilterSmoother_GpsPosVec.html">Up</a></td><td align="right" width="40%">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch15s09.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="40%">Warm-start the filter&nbsp;</td><td align="center" width="20%"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td valign="top" align="right" width="40%">&nbsp;References</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
